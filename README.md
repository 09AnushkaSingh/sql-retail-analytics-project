# Retail Sales & Customer Analytics (SQL Project)

## Project Overview:
**Project Type:** End to End Retail Data Analytics <br>
**Skills Demonstrated:** 
  * Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)
  * SQL Analytics (CTEs, Window Functions, Business Logic)
  * Business Insight Generation 

This project analyses real world retail transaction data to understand customer purchasing behavior, sales performance and revenue drivers.

The workflow follows an industry style analytics pipeline:
 * 1.Raw data cleaning and preparation using Python
 * 2.Creation of an analysis ready dataset
 * 3.Business focused analysis using SQL
 * 4.Insight generation for decision making


## Problem Statement & Objectives
Retail business generate massive transaction data but raw data alone does not creat value. <br>
This project aims to answer:
 * How does revenue vary across time, customers and products?
 * Which customers and transactions contribute most to revenue?
 * What sales patterns can help improve pricing and inventory decisions?
 * How can SQL be used to extract business insights from large datasets?

## Key Objectives
 * Clean and prepare raw retail data for analysis
 * Engineer meaningful features for business analysis
 * Perform structured SQL analysis on transactional data
 * Extract actionable insights for business stakeholders


## 📂Dataset Information
 * Original Dataset Size: 5,41,909 transaction records
 * Final Cleaned Dataset: 3,97,924 records
 * Dataset Type: Retail transactional data
To keep the repository GitHub friendly, a 10% sampled version of the cleaned dataset is uploaded.


## Tools & Technologies Used
**Python**
 * Pandas
 * NumPy
 * Jupyter Notebook

**SQL**
 * Aggregations
 * Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
 * Window Functions
 * Business Logic Queries


## 🔍Project Workflow
 **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)**

 Steps performed:
 * Removed cancelled transactions
 * Handled missing Customer IDs
 * Removed invalid quantities and prices
 * Converted date columns to proper datetime format
 * Created new features such as:
    * Total transaction amount
    * Year and Month columns
 * Exported final cleaned dataset
 * Created a 10% reproducible sample for GitHub upload


## SQL Business Analysis
SQL queries focus on:
 * Revenue trends over time
 * Customer level analysis
 * Transaction frequency patterns
 * Business KPIs using aggregations
 * Advanced SQL logic using CTEs and window functions


## 📊Key Insights Generated
 * Identified high value customers contributing most to revenue
 * Observed seasonality and monthly revenue trends
 * Analysed transaction behavior across different customer segments
 * Demonstrated how SQL supports real world business decision making


## ▶️How to Explore This Project
 * Start with the Python notebook to understand data cleaning and preparation
 * Review the sample dataset in the Dataset folder
 * Explore SQL queries inside the SQL folder for business analysis.


## 🚀Future Enhancements
 * Add Power BI dashboard for visual storytelling
 * Extend SQL analysis with more KPIs
 * Automate pipeline for larger datasets
