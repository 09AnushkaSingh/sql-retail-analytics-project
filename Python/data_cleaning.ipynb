# Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering (Python)

# 1. Import Libraries
# pandas, numpy, datetime

# 2. Load Raw Dataset
# Original online retail transactional data (~500K+ rows)

# 3. Initial Data Exploration
# - Dataset shape
# - Missing values
# - Invalid records

# 4. Data Cleaning Steps
# - Removed cancelled invoices
# - Dropped rows with missing CustomerID
# - Removed negative quantities and prices
# - Converted InvoiceDate to datetime format

# 5. Feature Engineering
# - Created TotalAmount = Quantity * UnitPrice
# - Extracted Year and Month from InvoiceDate

# 6. Final Dataset Shape
# ~397K rows after cleaning

# 7. Export Cleaned Dataset
# Saved cleaned CSV for SQL analysis

# 8. Created 10% reproducible sample for GitHub
# Used random_state for reproducibility
